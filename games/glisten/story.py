    print('This was the first time this had ever happened. \nFires, raging across all of the Amazon Forest in South America, had crossed over to North America, spreading at miles per minute. People, by the thousands were being killed, massacred by the unforgiving flames of the Fire. Yesterday was the day that it had come to us. The fire spread at what seemed to be miles per second, sprinting over in the direction of our house, bounding across mountainsides and hills as if they were clouds. Our house was surrounded by forest, dense forest stretching for miles upon end. Our only choice was to go to our bunker.\nWe ran, sprinted for our lives to the safe box under the earth, only to find that the fire had beaten us there. Or most of us. I was the only survivor...\n\n\nI woke up, greeted by an unfamiliar darkness. I could still hear fire from the day before, but did not know what time of day it was. ')
